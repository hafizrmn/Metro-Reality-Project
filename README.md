# Metro-Reality-Project
Developed version of Arrival RP, SAMP gamemode.

This gamemode is Originally from a Russian gamemode, called Arrival Roleplay, which i got on some russian forum. It also has russian language with it, but don't worry because i'm also doing full translation on the gamemode. Because i'm not a russian, perhaps if you are a russian and interested to help me translating the gamemode, feel free to contact me! Not only translator, i also need another scripter to help me developing the gamemode because i'm kinda busy with college thing right now.

#What's the difference?
Full-featured gamemode, you can try it in-game, those are:
- Unique Master Account System. 
 
This gamemode is using Master Account System, so instead of Connecting using your character name, you should enter your Master Account name to login to the server. Once you logged in, then you will be able to choose which character you'd like to use. You can create and delete a character directly. You can have up to 3 character on one master account.
- Dynamic House, Business, Gates, and Garages System.

This featured is basically just like another server. You can buy up a house, business, or a garage in-game. But of course we are giving something different, which is the Furniture system which you can also buy in-game. Design your house interior as creative as possible with hundreds of available furniture. Add some gates to secure your house and buy a garage to store your safely.
- Friendly and Fully-dialog system.

Almost everything in-game have fully functional dialog system to make you easier interacting. You 'll be able to choose many option through dialog instead of typing it after some command.
- Damaged Check System.

I'm not gonna lie that this system is just like the LSRP's damage system. When you hurt yourself, the system will records it and save it so you can easily check your condition or another player's condition. Simply by using '/damages [ID]' and it will shows you the wound.
- Unique passport system 

This Passport is just like your ID. You'll need a passport to do anything in-game, a passport can be created on The City Hall. Passport is uses on DMV, Work, Buying something. Basically almost everything.
- Unique work system. 

The work system is centered. There is something called Employement Center on the city and you need to register your self there to get a job and then you can go to the workplace.
- Unique DMV System. 
 
DMV system is very realistic. You are not easily getting a license here by buying or just do the test. Buy you'll need to register on the DMV Center, read the theory which contains basic in-game rules of Traffic, pass the theory exam, and then pass the practical exam. Each step should passed a paycheck first. So once again, you won't get your license so easy here.
- Realistic Vehicle System 
 
The Vehicle system is very unique and realistic. Its so realistic because there is no static vehicle -except for job- in this server, even for the factions. PD, FD, MD, even the Government have the same vehicle system as the player, but registered under the name of the Faction of course, only the member of the faction will be able to use the vehicle. So if a member of the faction destroy the car, it will not respawn on the HQ nor somewhere else. 

If a vehicle is destroyed on this server, it will be teleported back to the place it destroyed but with damaged condition. This system helps avoiding abuses. All vehicle, included faction vehicle, that has been destroyed need to be towed to nearest workshop so that the mechanic can fix the vehicle.

Under the same system, you can also modified your vehicle. We are using GTA Original System to avoid abuse on the mod (Abuse example on Normal System: Putting a spoiler on motorcycle). It means that the spoiler, rooftop, sideskirt, or anything else that available is depending on your vehicle. For example, if you are using Sultan, the available Mod is the Mod that fits on Sultan only. You can also change the color of your vehicle, giving a paintjob, neon, plate, and another available mod. Just go to the Workshop!
- Useable Gym Equipment. 

Gym Equipment on some Gym and some Faction's HQ are useable. You can use it to practice, but unfortunately, it has no other function instead of animation. You can use it just like typing test, you need to type the word that appears on your screen. If you missed it, then it will considered failed and automatically stoped. We are hoping to develops this system into muscle system, which will affect your health and power.
